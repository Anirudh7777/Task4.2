1)Primary Key- The primary key is defined as a column (or set of columns)
               where each value is unique and identifies a single row of 
               the table.
  
  Foreign Key-A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table 
              that references the primary key columns in another table.


2)OnetoOne Mapping-
           . The One-To-One mapping represents a single-valued association
             where an instance of one entity is associated with an instance
             of another entity.
           . In this type of association one instance of source entity can 
             be mapped atmost one instance of target entity.
  @JoinColumn-
           . @JoinColumn is used to specify a column for joining an entity
             association or element collection.
           . This annotation indicates that the enclosing entity is the
             owner of the relationship and the corresponding table has a 
             foreign key column which references to the table of the
             non-owning side.

Difference between unidirectional mapping and bidirectional mapping-
            .If you have a unidirectional @OneToMany association, it means
             you can only access the relationship from the parent side where
             the foreign key resides. 


            .For the bidirectional @OneToMany association, you can navigate
             the association in both ways, either from the parent or from the
             child side.
